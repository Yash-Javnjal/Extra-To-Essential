# Extra-To-Essential
Food waste and hunger coexist. Edible surplus from restaurants and events is discarded, while NGOs lack real-time system to source food efficiently.  
We propose a centralized digital platform that enables real-time surplus listing, smart NGO matching, transparent delivery tracking, creating a structured and reliable food redistribution network.
